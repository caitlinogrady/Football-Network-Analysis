# Football-Network-Analysis

This is a project done for my SI608 class at the University of Michigan. The goal of this project was to create a network of D1 College football players, D1 colleges, and NFL football teams. These nodes were connected with edges to represent which college players attended and which NFL team they got drafted to, with weights representing the round they got drafted in. This network was used to calculate network features in order to build a ML model in order to predict what team players will get drafted to.
